# T.S. Eliot's *The Waste Land* in XML/TEI
*The Waste Land* has been in the public domain in the United States since January 1, 1998. 

*The Waste Land* is a landmark 20th-century poem that explores themes of disillusionment in the aftermath of World War I. 
Its rich use of literary references and analysis of the human condition make is so important to perserve it for progeny.

Obvious work in progress. Plan is for 
- XML/TEI representation of T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land
- XSL transformation of the TEI?
- Incorporate Apache Lucene Java library for retrieval queries // text analysis
- Jupyter notebook for quality of life?
